# TODO List

## ✅ Recently Completed (Phase 6 - January 21, 2026)

### LLM Translation System
- ✅ **Dynamic Breed Info Translation**: LLM-powered translation of temperament, description, origin, traits
- ✅ **Client-Side Caching**: Prevents redundant LLM API calls with `translatedBreedInfo` state
- ✅ **Vietnamese Support**: Full translation system with proper re-rendering via useEffect
- ✅ **Chinese Traditional Support**: Added zh-tw with 143 lines of translations
- ✅ **Translation Prompt Engineering**: Fixed LLM translating JSON keys issue
- ✅ **Auto-Translation Trigger**: useEffect hook for proper state updates and re-renders

### Image Verification System
- ✅ **Vision AI Integration**: Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo for image validation
- ✅ **Automatic Verification**: Verifies images when fetched from Dog CEO API
- ✅ **Confidence Scoring**: 0-100% confidence with mismatch detection
- ✅ **Fallback Strategy**: OpenRouter fallback when Together AI vision unavailable
- ✅ **German Shepherd Fix**: Deleted incorrect image for re-fetch with verification

### Comprehensive Health Check System
- ✅ **Phase 6 Health Check**: 10-category validation with 66 automated checks
- ✅ **Image Verification Script**: Test suite for validating all breed images
- ✅ **Language Validation**: Automated checks for all 12 translation files
- ✅ **NPM Scripts**: `health:phase6` and `test:images` commands
- ✅ **Security Validation**: API key detection, .gitignore verification

### Production Deployment (January 21, 2026)
- ✅ **Docker Build Optimization**: Switched from Alpine to Debian for native module support
- ✅ **Fixed Build Dependencies**: Added Python, make, g++ for @parcel/watcher compilation
- ✅ **TypeScript Type Safety**: Fixed type assertions for response.json() calls
- ✅ **Docker Networking**: Created pet-network for container communication
- ✅ **Container Naming**: Named container 'app' to match Caddyfile reverse proxy config
- ✅ **Successful VPS Deployment**: Phase 6 now live at https://aibreeds-demo.com
- ✅ **Dockerfile Lessons Learned**: Documented Alpine vs Debian tradeoffs for Next.js

### Bug Fixes
- ✅ **Vietnamese Translation Display**: Fixed state update not triggering re-render
- ✅ **JSON Syntax Errors**: Fixed ar.json, ru.json, it.json duplicate closing braces
- ✅ **Translation Field Names**: LLM now keeps English keys, only translates values
- ✅ **Language Mapping**: All 12 languages properly mapped in page.tsx
- ✅ **Regex JSON Parsing**: Updated regex to handle nested JSON objects properly
- ✅ **Package Lock Sync**: Fixed package-lock.json out-of-sync issues

## ✅ Recently Completed (January 23, 2026) - Cat Image Bug Fixes

### Missing Cat Breed Images
- ✅ **Himalayan Image 404 Fixed**: Fetched from TheCatAPI and cached successfully
- ✅ **Maine Coon Image 404 Fixed**: Fetched from TheCatAPI and cached successfully  
- ✅ **Health Check Enhanced**: verify-breed-images.js now tests both cats and dogs
- ✅ **Pet Type Detection**: Added regex parsing to extract petType from breedData.ts
- ✅ **Image Fetch Script**: Created fetch-missing-cat-images.js for automated fetching
- ✅ **NPM Script Added**: `npm run fetch:cat-images` command
- ✅ **Vision Verification**: Images validated with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo
- ✅ **Cache Updated**: .cache-metadata.json updated with verification results
- ✅ **Code Pushed to GitHub**: Commit c9dc9b9 - ready for production deployment
- ✅ **Deployed to Production**: Successfully deployed with fixed cat images

### Deployment Process Standardization
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Docker containers not using VPS .env file
- ✅ **Fixed 401 Errors**: Container now loads API keys via `--env-file .env`
- ✅ **Standardized Deployment**: Created deploy-production-standard.sh script
- ✅ **Documentation**: Created DEPLOYMENT-STANDARD-PROCESS.md guide
- ✅ **Security Improved**: Real API keys only on VPS, placeholders in git
- ✅ **Automated Validation**: Script checks env file and API keys before deployment

## 📋 Phase 8 - Future Enhancements (Planned)

### Local Docker Testing
- 🔄 **Pre-Production Docker Validation**: Test Dockerfile.prod on local laptop before VPS deployment
  - Build image locally: `docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t pet-portal:test .`
  - Run local container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env pet-portal:test`
  - Verify build success and runtime behavior
  - Catch TypeScript errors, dependency issues, and config problems early
  - **Benefit**: Save VPS troubleshooting time, avoid failed deployments

### Simplified Deployment Script
- 🔄 **One-Command VPS Deployment**: Create streamlined deployment automation
  - Script: `scripts/deploy-to-vps.sh`
  - Features:
    * SSH into VPS
    * Pull latest code from GitHub
    * Build Docker image with progress monitoring
    * Create Docker network if needed
    * Stop old containers gracefully
    * Start new containers with health checks
    * Verify deployment success
    * Auto-rollback on failure
  - Usage: `./scripts/deploy-to-vps.sh` (single command)
  - **Benefit**: Reduce deployment complexity, minimize human error

### Docker Compose for Production
- 🔄 **Unified Container Orchestration**: Use docker-compose.yml on VPS
  - Define services: app, caddy
  - Automatic network creation
  - Volume management
  - Restart policies
  - Health checks
  - One command: `docker-compose up -d`
  - **Benefit**: Simplify multi-container management

### Deployment Testing Checklist
- 🔄 **Pre-Deployment Validation**:
  1. Run `npm run build` locally (TypeScript validation)
  2. Build Docker image locally (dependency validation)
  3. Test container locally (runtime validation)
  4. Run health checks: `npm run health:phase6`
  5. Verify image cache: `npm run test:images`
  6. Check environment variables in .env
  7. Only then deploy to VPS
  - **Benefit**: Catch 95% of issues before production

## Known Issues - To Be Addressed Later

### Missing Cat Breed Images (Being Fixed)
- **Status**: In Progress - Images will be fetched on next access
- **Issue**: Some cat breed images not yet cached locally
  - `/breeds/himalayan.jpg` - Will be fetched from TheCatAPI
  - `/breeds/mainecoon.jpg` - Will be fetched from TheCatAPI
- **Impact**: 404 errors in browser console until images are fetched
- **Root Cause**: Cat breed images not pre-cached during initial development
- **Action Taken**:
  1. ✅ Fixed health check script to test BOTH dog and cat breeds
  2. ✅ Enhanced breed verification to properly detect cat vs dog breeds
  3. 🔄 Images will be automatically fetched and verified on next access
- **Priority**: Medium (affects user experience for these specific breeds)
- **Detected**: January 23, 2026 - Production testing

### Missing Placeholder Images (404 Errors)
- **Status**: Non-critical - UI cosmetic issue
- **Issue**: Decorative background images referenced in older documentation don't exist
  - `/breeds/labrador.jpg` - ✅ EXISTS (cached)
  - Note: These were listed in older docs but are not actually causing issues
- **Impact**: No current impact - previously referenced decorative images removed
- **Priority**: Low (resolved, no action needed)
- **Detected**: January 21, 2026 - Phase 4 Mobile Optimization testing

### Hugging Face LLM Provider Not Working
- **Status**: Blocked - API deprecated
- **Issue**: Hugging Face deprecated their old Inference API endpoint
  - Old endpoint: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co` returns 410 Gone
  - New endpoint: `https://router.huggingface.co` returns 404 Not Found
- **Impact**: Currently removed from provider chain (using Together AI + OpenRouter)
- **Action Needed**: 
  1. Research Hugging Face's new Serverless Inference API documentation
  2. Update `HuggingFaceProvider` implementation in `src/lib/llm-providers.ts`
  3. Test with API key and re-enable in provider order
- **Priority**: Low (Together AI provides free tier as alternative)

## Deployment Tasks

### VPS/Caddy/Next.js Deployment Troubleshooting

1. Identify which process is using port 80 and stop it.
2. Restart the docker compose stack cleanly.
3. Verify the Caddy container is exposing ports 80 and 443.
4. Check Caddy logs for SSL/certificate errors.
5. Test public access to https://aibreeds-demo.com.
6. Document and automate recovery steps for future deployments.

_Resume from here next session to resolve port conflicts and ensure public access is working._
