# TODO for VPS/Caddy/Next.js Deployment Troubleshooting

1. Identify which process is using port 80 and stop it.
2. Restart the docker compose stack cleanly.
3. Verify the Caddy container is exposing ports 80 and 443.
4. Check Caddy logs for SSL/certificate errors.
5. Test public access to https://aibreeds-demo.com.
6. Document and automate recovery steps for future deployments.

_Resume from here next session to resolve port conflicts and ensure public access is working._
